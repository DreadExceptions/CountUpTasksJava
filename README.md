Count Up Tasks 2.0

This is the second version of Count Up Tasks. This particular version is created with Java, and there are plans for a JavaScript version in the future. This version maintains the basis of the original program, but the design has been revised.

Count Up Tasks is designed to help people create to-do lists and got-done lists. Furthermore, statistics in relation to completed tasks are an integral part of the program, showing the user what they have and haven't gotten done.

These are the basic features of Count Up Tasks 2.0:
* A simple task list
* The ability to add sub-tasks and add details to existing tasks
* Task statistics
* Weekly scheduling, utilizing the tasks from the simple task list.
